Step 1: Run the "surveyDriver" class. This will display the Main Menu.

Step 2a: Click "Premade Surveys" to play pre-made surveys.
Step 2b: Click "Create a Survey" to create and play your own survey.

Step 3: For premade surveys, for each question select an answer and click submit. You can change your answer
however many times you like, as long as your final answer is chosen before it is submitted.

Step 4: For creating surveys, fill in the empty text fields with answers to questions, the furthest left 
column is to be used for custom survey questions. Erase the text in the "title" and "thank you message" text fields
and replace them with your own. Once this step is completed, press the "save and play" button to play the
custom survey.
